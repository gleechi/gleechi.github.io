* [Explanations](virtual_grasp.html) lead you to learn about fundamental concepts in VirtualGrasp.
* [How-To Guides](unity_component_myvirtualgrasp.html) are recipes that guide you through the components involved in addressing key problems and use-cases.
* [References](virtualgrasp_unityapi.html) contain technical reference for VirtualGrasp APIs and components as well as release notes. They describe how it works and how to use it, but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts in **Explanations**.
