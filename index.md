As a general guideline:

* Look for **Explanations** in our [Knowledge Base](knowledge_base.html) to find out about the fundamental concepts in the VirtualGrasp Engine.
* Look for **Tutorials** in the Code. Each of the [Scripts](VirtualGrasp_UnityAPI.html#scripts) can be understood as a tutorial on how to use the VirtualGrasp API.
* Look for **References** in our [API reference](VirtualGrasp_UnityAPI.html) to get a full list of functions and components of the VirtualGrasp API.
* there are no **How-Tos** yet.
