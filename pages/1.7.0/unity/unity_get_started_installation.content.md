### Supported Platforms and Unity Engine Versions

{% include callout.html content="VirtualGrasp SDK <ins>**only supports Windows Standalone and Android builds.**</ins><br><br> Other platforms such as Linux, iOS, MacOS, etc, are not supported at the moment." %}

In our experience Unity and the VirtualGrasp SDK are very robust in terms of up- or downgrading inside a major Unity version (e.g., 2020.x.x, 2021.x.x, etc) for your projects.

The following is a list of Unity Engine versions that we have tested the VirtualGrasp SDK with:

{% include callout.html content="
**Unity 2019.x and earlier** is not and will not be supported due to the lack of ArticulationBody components.<br><br>
<ins>**Unity 2020.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.<br><br>
<ins>**Unity 2021.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.<br><br>
<ins>**Unity 2022.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.<br>
&nbsp;>> Unity 2022.3 is the version that we are currently using to create the SDK.<br><br>
<ins>**Unity 2023.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.<br><br>
" %}

### Getting Started with VirtualGrasp and the Console View

There is only one minimal main component you have to add by default to use and configure VirtualGrasp: [MyVirtualGrasp.cs](unity_component_myvirtualgrasp.1.7.0.html). Adding a component to your scene and playing your scene, you should see some messages produced by the plugin in the Console Window.

You can identify that VG has been successfully initialized when a message like these appear on the Console, also informing you of the SDK version:

{% include callout.html content="Initialized VirtualGrasp SDK (version 1.7.0-full)." %}

{% include image.html file="unity/unity_console_initialization.png" alt="VG Console Initialization" caption="VirtualGrasp initialization message in the Unity console." %}

{% include tip.html content="Whenever something related to the VirtualGrasp plugin does not work as expected, first have a look at the Console. In most cases, you will be able to identify issues through error messages that are generated by the plugin." %}
