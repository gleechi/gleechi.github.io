## Description

VG_PostAnimator is a {% include tooltip.html tooltip="VGPublicScript" text="public script" %} that exemplifies how you could overwrite ("post-animate") grasp animations that are generated by VirtualGrasp.

The emphasis here that this is merely an example, and that the important thing is that it is possible to overwrite grasp animations with your own animations 
during grasping by adding a listener to the [VG_Controller.OnPostUpdate](virtualgrasp_unityapi.0.13.0.html#onpostupdate) event.

{% include multiple_script.html %}

## Simple Use Case

In this simple example script, the VR trigger button (value between 0 and 1) is used to slerp the rotation of the index finger between the current bone rotation 
(generated by VirtualGrasp) and a manually defined target rotation. 

This is a use case that you may want to follow if you want to animate a finger push while you have an object in your hand (such as when using an electric tool). 

The video shows the behavior you would get when attaching a VG_PostAnimator to the Antenna object in the onboarding scene (VirtualGrasp\Scenes\onboarding\VG_Onboarding.unity).

## Complex Use Case

Manually programming your animations will allow you to implement more complex use cases, such as creating finger animations on an articulated object, for example scissors.
