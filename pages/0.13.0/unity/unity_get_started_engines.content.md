In our experience Unity and the VirtualGrasp SDK are very robust in terms of up- or downgrading inside a major Unity version (e.g., 2020.x.x, 2021.x.x, etc) for your projects.

The following is a list of Unity Engine versions that we have tested the VirtualGrasp SDK with:

* **Unity 2019.x and earlier** are not supported due to the lack of ArticulationBody components. We are working on support.
* <ins>**Unity 2020.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.
* <ins>**Unity 2021.x**</ins> is supported and has been tested successfully.
  * **Unity 2021.3** is the version that we are currently using to create the SDK.
* **Unity 2022.x** support is under development / not supported yet.
