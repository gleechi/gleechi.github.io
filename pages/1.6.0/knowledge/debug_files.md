## Creating Debug Files
{% include image.html file="unity/unity_vg_debug_settings_1_5_0.png" alt="VG Debug Settings." caption="VG debug settings." %}

We can enable creation of a set of debug files (see [Debug Files Content](#debug-files-content) below) which is saved in a *vg_tmp* subdirectory in your projectâ€™s Asset folder. 

There are two ways to create them

1. Enabling **Export Scene in Runtime** allows you to create debug files after launching the scene in the Editor. The benefit of this is to be able to include objects you spawn in runtime or those you add by loading another scene during runtime into the debug files. Note the full debug files process is only in effect in development mode (i.e. using the Unity Editor), but not in builds.

2. Pressing **Export Scene in Editor** will simulate a launch of the VG plugin from the Unity Editor, thus without the need of launching the scene. This option is provided for convenience, but objects that are not in your scene yet will not be included.

{% include important.html content="Each creation of debug files is scene-dependent, meaning that it only relates to the **current** Unity scene. Thus, to complement debug files from multiple scenes, you have to launch these scenes separately with **Export Scene in Runtime** enabled if you export in runtime, or press **Export Current Scene** after opening each scene." %}

{% include important.html content="It is recommended to delete the vg_tmp folder whenever you start with a new debug file creation process, since existing and potentially outdated data will not be deleted (only potentially overwritten)." %}<br>

## Debug Files Content

* One *.obj* file for each {% include tooltip.html tooltip="VGInteractable" text="interactable" %} object in the scene, i.e. raw 3D mesh data in uniform scale.
* One *.bin* file for each avatar (containing one or a pair of hands of this avatar).
* One *.log* file with VG log data (the same that also appears on the Console) for the scene that you are running, will be filled while you are running the scene.
* One *.db* file carrying data filled with [VG_GraspEditor](unity_component_vggraspeditor.1.6.0.html) or [VG_BakingClient](unity_component_vgbakingclient.1.6.0.html).
* One *.scn* and one *.scn.objrig* file for each scene, including scene configuration data (see section [Debugging Interaction Issues](#debugging-interaction-issues) to learn about these {% include tooltip.html tooltip="VGSceneFiles" text="VG scene files" %}).

## How To Use The Debug Files

### Object Baking

A *.zip* file of all the content in *vg_tmp* folder is the input that is needed for [object baking](object_baking.1.6.0.html).

### Debugging Interaction Issues

When you stop the scene, two scene configuration files for each Unity or Unreal scene will be saved: 
* *.scn*: Is a JSON representation of the current state of the scene including VG interaction setup and all interactable objects' status at the moment of saving. 
* *.scn.objrig* completely corresponds to the *.scn* file, but uses indentation to represent object hierarchy. 

These scene files reveals *how VG sees the status of your current scene* in your VR application. 
Because of this, they are very useful for you to debug any VG-related interaction issues that you experience. 
For example:

* {% include tooltip.html tooltip="ObjectHierarchy" text="object hierarchy" %}: you thought you placed antenna as the child of radio. To see if it is really that way in VG, you can check the *.scn* file. 
* {% include tooltip.html tooltip="SelectionWeight" text="selection weight" %}: you thought you have changed the selection weight on the antenna to 0, but it is actually not when checking the *.scn* file. 
* {% include tooltip.html tooltip="Affordance" text="affordance" %}: you thought you have set the radio to be pushable (FINGER_PUSHABLE), but it is actually only graspable (ONLY_GRASPABLE).

{% include callout.html content="Since .scn files are written at the moment when you stop playing the scene, the saved information reflects your scene configuration at that moment. 
So if you in runtime, for example, changed an object's joint type or selection weight, then the resulting .scn files will reflect the effective values after your runtime changes." %}
