### Task Description

{% include youtube.html id="7QCeKYOZMVc" %}

#### Interaction behaviors wanted

* We want to be able to use primary grasp as a basis to grasp and manipulate an articuclated object, plier.
* We want to use the controller's GRIP button to control grasp, and once the plier is grasped, to use TRIGGER button to animate closing opening of the plier.

### Solution

In VirtualGrasp SDK, we packed the solution of this task in **VirtualGrasp/Scenes/onboarding**.
