MyVirtualGraspBurst is a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.CoreScript}}">Core Script</a>. 
It inherits from VG_MainScript, which wraps the main communication functions of the API. 
VG_MainScript inherits from Monobehavior so you can use this as a component to a GameObject in Unity. 
In contrast to MyVirtualGrasp, this component uses Burst Jobs to isolate VG updates on a seperate thread.

[Currently this component does not function]
