This doc is based on the Documentation Theme for Jekyll:
https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html#

The repository serves the VirtualGrasp documentation at https://docs.gleechi.com.

If you are a contributor, please follow the installation instructions so you can 
run **jekyll serve** while changing the documentation and before pushing changes.

Here are some pointers for updating main content:

* **_data/sidebars**: contains .yml files for all page sidebars.
* **_includes**: contains custom .html scripts for plugins that you can use in your pages.
* **pages**: contains .md files for all the major content
  * Note that Unity VirtualGrasp_UnityAPI.md is auto-generated, thus you should not change the content.
